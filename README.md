# Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction-with-Enhanced-Accuracy-using-Machine-Learning-Models

The project focuses on predicting credit card approvals based on customer information, a crucial task for a bank's credit card department. In an era where data-driven decisions are paramount, this project addresses the challenge of acquiring new credit card customers while ensuring creditworthiness.

## Data Features (Credit_Card.csv):
1. Ind_ID: Client ID
2. Gender, Car_owner, Propert_owner: Personal information
3. Children, Annual_income, Type_Income: Financial details
4. Education, Marital_status, Housing_type: Personal and living details
5. Birthday_count, Employed_days: Employment details
6. Mobile_phone, Work_phone, Phone, EMAIL_ID: Contact details
7. Type_Occupation, Family_Members: Occupation and family size

## Additional Data (Credit_card_label.csv):
ID (Ind_ID): Joining key
Label: 0 (approved), 1 (rejected)

## Initial Hypothesis:
1. Credit card approval is influenced by factors such as annual income, education, and employment status.
2. Utilizing machine learning models will uncover patterns and improve accuracy.
3. The proposed model will outperform others, justified by relevant cost functions and graphical comparisons.

## Machine Learning Approach:
1. Method: Utilize a Decision Tree model for credit card approval predictions.
2. Improvement Steps: Implement data scaling techniques to enhance model accuracy.
3. Model Comparison: Compare at least four models, justifying the selection based on cost functions.
